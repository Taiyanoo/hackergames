    Mining games exploded a few years ago and they're still hanging around as people keep digging into the genre leading to revisiting titles like Terraria. On the surface, this pixel world looks so friendly, colorful, and peaceful. The more you explore, the more you discover that there's plenty of danger hiding on the surface as well as hidden deep within the ground. The good thing is that you're a resourceful adventurer. All you need to do is spend some time swinging away with tools and then you'll be able to craft better chances at survival. Respect the terror of Terraria.
